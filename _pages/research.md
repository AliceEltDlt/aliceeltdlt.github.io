##  Can unconventional monetary policy contribute to climate action? ##
Joint work with Andrea Giulio Maino, SFI@UNIGE

*Abstract:* This paper investigates the impact of central banks when supporting policies aiming at greening the financial system. The July 2021 Monetary Policy Strategy Review of the European Central Bank unexpectedly dedicated a whole workstream to climate change. The announcement had a significant effect on the pricing and issuance of green bonds in the Eurozone. We find that ECB eligible green bondsâ€™ Yield-to-Maturity decreased following the announcement when compared to equivalent conventional bonds. Firms incorporated in the Eurozone reacted to the announcement by increasing the amount of green bonds issued. The effect is concentrated in the segment of investment-grade green bonds and among seasoned green bond issuers. As only half of the effect measured can be attributed to green bonds with a Second-Party Opinion, our results also suggest that central banks should target more transparent issuance to reduce the risk of greenwashing.
