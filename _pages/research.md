##  Can unconventional monetary policy contribute to climate action? ##
Joint work with Andrea Giulio Maino, SFI@UNIGE

*Abstract:* This paper investigates the impact of central banks when supporting policies aiming at greening the
financial system. The July 2021 Monetary Policy Strategy Review of the European Central Bank unexpectedly
dedicated a whole workstream to climate change. The announcement had a significant effect on
the pricing and issuance of green bonds in the Eurozone. We find that ECB-eligible green bondsâ€™ Yield-to-
Maturity decreased following the announcement when compared to equivalent conventional bonds.
Firms incorporated in the Eurozone reacted to the announcement by increasing the amount of green
bond issued, for both the segments of ECB-eligible and non-ECB-eligible green bonds.
